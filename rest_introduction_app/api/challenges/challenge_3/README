HOW TO COLLECT FLAGS IN CHALLENGE 3:

nucleocreator -> call POST /nucleotide endpoint (10 times)
aminoacid_appender -> call POST /triplets endpoint (10 times)
mutator -> call PATCH /triplets/{triplet_id} endpoint (10 times)
reductor -> call DELETE /triplets/{triplet_id} endpoint (10 times)
eradicator -> the flag is completed once the sequence is deleted (0 nucleotides, empty sample)
architect -> call POST /triplets endpoint (50 times)
observer -> call GET /sample_sequence endpoint (5 times)

proteomaster -> all above flags collected + call GET /translation endpoint
